# Workshop Overview

We will be going over the basics of Kubernetes and primarily focusing on the developer experience. We will be going over how to deploy software in a scaled and distributed way, how to expose applications via ingress, and how to manage configuration and secrets.

**NOTE**  
This is by **no** means a comprehenisve list of the capabilites of Kubernetes. This is intended for a beginner to Kubernetes and is by no means an exhaustive demonstration of the capabilites of Kubernetes. It will provide a gentle introduction of some of the concepts from an application developer's point of view.

## What is Kubernetes 

Kubernetees (often called K8s) is an open-source container orchestration framework that handles application deployment, scaling and lifecycle. We won't re-hash everything about Kubernetes in this Workshop. I recommend reading up on Kubernetes from the official [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io) website.
